    @Intro(title: "Gradient descent") {
        Gradient descent optimization is a powerful technique for optimizing arbitrary parameters in a complex system to arrive at a desired result.
        
        This tutorial will demonstrate the use of gradient descent to train a perceptron to perform a boolean logic function.
