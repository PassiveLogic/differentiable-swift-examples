# Sharp edges in differentiable Swift

This is an overview of some of the currently missing capabilities in differentiable Swift.

## Overview

This is an overview of some of the currently missing capabilities in differentiable Swift you may encounter when working with the feature. Inspired by the original [Swift for TensorFlow notebook](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/tutorials/Swift_autodiff_sharp_edges), we intend for this to be an up-to-date and comprehensive list of common issues you may encounter when working with differentiable Swift.

- Forward mode differentiation (`@differentiable(forward)` JVPs) is only partially implemented.
- Differentiation through `_modify` subscript accessors (like array subscript setters) isn't supported yet.
- Differentiation through `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient` tagged functions isnâ€™t yet supported. The most common cases of these are in SIMD functions, like `.sum()`.
- `map()` and `reduce()` cannot be differentiated through directly, instead there are special functions for `differentiableMap()` and `differentiableReduce()`.
- No support yet in the standard library for Dictionary differentiation.
- `for..in` loops currently require using `withoutDerivative(at:)` on the collection you're looping over.
