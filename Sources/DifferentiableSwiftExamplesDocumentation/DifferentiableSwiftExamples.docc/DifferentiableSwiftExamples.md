Articles and tutorials on the experimental language feature of differentiable Swift.

## Overview

Differentiable Swift is an experimental language feature for the [Swift language](https://www.swift.org) that is currently
in the [pitch phase](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147) of
the Swift Evolution process. The goal of this feature is to provide first-class, language-integrated support for
differentiable programming, making Swift the first general-purpose, statically typed programming language to have automatic
differentiation built in.

Differentiable Swift is purely a language feature and isn't tied to any specific machine learning framework or platform.
It provides a means of building such frameworks in Swift, and works wherever Swift does: from Linux to macOS to
 [WebAssembly](https://swiftwasm.org).
